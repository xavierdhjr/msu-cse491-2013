Blog post assignments
=====================
Hello world


Up to two students may sign up to write a blog post about each class
day, and each student may sign up for two blog posts total.  Each blog
post will count towards half a project at the end of the class (i.e.
2 blog posts will satisfy 10% of your grade).

To sign up for a blog post, go to @@, fork the repo, edit this document,
and submit a pull request to me to merge it back in.

Content
-------

Blog posts should discuss most of the following in ~5-7 paragraphs/400
words minimum:

 * An outline of what was discussed in class;

 * Relevant links that were brought up, and how/why they're relevant;

 * Your thoughts (including agreements or disagreements) on any
   opinions expressed by the instructor or by other students.

You can also add:

 * Other links on related topics that you found interesting;

 * Additional thoughts that you wanted to bring;

 * Relevant personal experiences.
